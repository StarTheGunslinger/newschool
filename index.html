                <h2>Daisuke</h2>
                <p>Desciption: Daisuke might be the most optimistic crew member. He is almost always enthusiastic and excited about things happening around the ship: 
                    the mentee seems to have felt like he was doing his part just with the menial task of taking stock of the kitchen four times over, as ordered by 
                    an exasperated Swansea. Even after the crash, he tries to keep his spirit up. However, despite his peppy exterior, Daisuke later in the game drunkenly 
                    confesses to Jimmy that he struggles to find meaning in life.</p>
