                <h2>Anya</h2>
                <p>Decription: Anya is a kind, intelligent, determined young woman who has a passion for nursing and a sense of humor. Despite having been through medical school 8 times and failing, she continues to go, showing her love and determination for medicine.
                    Before her assault, she was seemingly much more lively, getting along well with and trusting the rest of the crew which likely included Jimmy. She is knowledgeable about the company guidelines and rules, as she brought up the safety manual of Pony Express to find a way to reach the cargo.
                    Reserved and easily nervous after her assault, she has a soft-spoken demeanor and acts meek around the rest of the crew, seeking to avoid Jimmy and protect herself from him. Also hiding the gun case in the medical room so that Jimmy can't find it, fearing for the worst.
                    Post crash, her mental health declines rapidly as Jimmy declares himself captain. She is prone to breakdowns, experiences anxiety, and tends to isolate herself more often than not taking care of Curly. Anya barely speaks for the rest of the game, especially when talking to Jimmy.
                    She seems to have a sense of humor from the yimpy sticky note she pinned, her playful teasing of Swansea enjoying the Pony Express cake, and a competitive streak in board games.
                    She is also mentioned to have been reading a lot of books about psychology while on the Tulpar.</p>

                <h2>Daisuke</h2>
                <p>Desciption: Daisuke might be the most optimistic crew member. He is almost always enthusiastic and excited about things happening around the ship: 
                    the mentee seems to have felt like he was doing his part just with the menial task of taking stock of the kitchen four times over, as ordered by 
                    an exasperated Swansea. Even after the crash, he tries to keep his spirit up. However, despite his peppy exterior, Daisuke later in the game drunkenly 
                    confesses to Jimmy that he struggles to find meaning in life.</p>
